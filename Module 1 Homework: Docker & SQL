Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

Question 1: Understanding Docker First Run

Run Docker with the python:3.12.8 image in interactive mode using bash as the entrypoint.

Solution:

To find the pip version:

1.Run the following command:

docker run -it python:3.12.8 bash

2.Inside the container, check the pip version:

pip --version

Answer: 23.3.1

Question 2: Understanding Docker Networking and docker-compose

Given docker-compose.yaml

services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data

Question: What is the hostname and port that pgAdmin should use to connect to the Postgres database?

Solution:

From the docker-compose.yaml, the Postgres service is named db, and it maps port 5433 on the host to 5432 inside the container.

Answer: db:5432

Question 3: Trip Segmentation Count

Question:

For trips between October 1st, 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st, 2019 (exclusive), how many trips fall into these categories:

1.Up to 1 mile

2.Between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive)

3.Between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive)

4.Between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive)

5.Over 10 miles

SQL Query:

SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS up_to_1_mile,
  SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 1 AND trip_distance <= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_1_and_3_miles,
  SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 3 AND trip_distance <= 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_3_and_7_miles,
  SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 7 AND trip_distance <= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_7_and_10_miles,
  SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS over_10_miles
FROM green_tripdata
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
  AND lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-11-01';

Answer:

104,793; 201,407; 110,612; 27,831; 35,281

Question 4: Longest Trip for Each Day

Question:

Which day had the longest trip distance?

SQL Query:

SELECT
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) AS pickup_date,
  MAX(trip_distance) AS max_distance
FROM green_tripdata
GROUP BY DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY max_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;

Answer: 2019-10-15

Question 5: Three Biggest Pickup Zones

Question:

Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in total_amount for 2019-10-18?

SQL Query:

SELECT
  zone AS pickup_zone,
  SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM green_tripdata gt
JOIN taxi_zone_lookup tz ON gt.PULocationID = tz.LocationID
WHERE DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-10-18'
GROUP BY zone
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 13000
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

Answer:

East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights

Question 6: Largest Tip

Question:

For passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone "East Harlem North," which drop-off zone had the largest tip?

SQL Query:

SELECT
  dropoff_zone,
  MAX(tip_amount) AS largest_tip
FROM (
  SELECT
    tz1.zone AS pickup_zone,
    tz2.zone AS dropoff_zone,
    tip_amount
  FROM green_tripdata gt
  JOIN taxi_zone_lookup tz1 ON gt.PULocationID = tz1.LocationID
  JOIN taxi_zone_lookup tz2 ON gt.DOLocationID = tz2.LocationID
  WHERE tz1.zone = 'East Harlem North'
    AND DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-10-01' AND '2019-10-31'
) trips
GROUP BY dropoff_zone
ORDER BY largest_tip DESC
LIMIT 1;

Answer: JFK Airport

Question 7: Terraform Workflow

Question:

Which sequence describes the Terraform workflow for:

1.Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend

2.Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan

3.Removing all resources managed by Terraform

Answer:
